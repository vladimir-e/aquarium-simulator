            Review this PR. Be direct and efficient - no fluff.

            **Review format:**
            - If PR is good: Just comment "LGTM" (nothing else)
            - If issues found: List only actionable items, categorized as:
              - **Critical:** Must fix before merge (bugs, security, breaking changes)
              - **Recommended:** Should fix (code quality, performance)
              - **Optional:** Nice-to-have improvements

            **Review scope:**
            - Bugs and correctness, especially simulation logic issues
            - System architecture issues or suggestions
            - Performance problems
            - Code quality
            - Test coverage gaps

            **Do NOT:**
            - Praise what's good (assume it's fine if not mentioned)
            - Summarize what the PR does (author knows)
            - Use sandwich feedback format

            Use the repository's CLAUDE.md for project conventions.
            Use `gh pr comment` with your Bash tool to post your review.
